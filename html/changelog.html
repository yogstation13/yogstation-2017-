				<li class="rscadd">This isn't really related to anything but did you know that if you give a slime morphine or frost oil it slows down, and you can become better friends with a slime by feeding it plasma? Or just order it to attack people by saying 'attack (person's full name.) Seriously, I was surprised to find a lot of this stuff out.</li>
