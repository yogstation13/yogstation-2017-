      crew is to catch him during a vunerable moment.
  - rscremove: Due to the addition of proper liching, skeletons as a choosable race

      is used for all the remaining calculations instead of Armour (Eg: 80 Melee -

  - rscadd: The spells disintegrate and flesh to stone have had their mechanics changed.
      Using these spells will spawn a special touch weapon in a free hand (your dominant
      hand if possible) that can then be used to inflict the spell on the target of
      your choice. Having the touch weapon out is obvious, this is not a stealth based
      change. Clicking the spell while the hand is out will let you return the charge
      without using it.
  - rscdel: The spell won't begin to recharge until the hand attack is either used
      or returned. Additionally these changes mean you can no longer use these spells
      while stunned or handcuffed. As a suggestion remember that the mutate spell
      allows you to break out of cuffs very easily, and warping abilities will keep
      you from getting cuffed to begin with!

  - rscdel: Removed feature where quick consecutive ghost orbits while moving could
      be used to fuck with your sprite

      thing moved in certain situations.
  - rscadd: Ghost Orbit size now changes based on the icon size of the thing they
      are orbiting (for that sweet sweet singulo orbiting action)

      needles - they are now able to penetrate armor.

  Gun Hog, for WJohnston:

      way to growing into a full queen, and a queen may promote one if there is not
      one already.'

      they are considered royals.

  - bugfix: All forms of dead xenomorph may now be grabbed and placed on a surgery
      table for organ harvesting!

  - tweak: A recent Nanotrasen firmware update to drones has increased vulnerability
      to foreign influences. Please periodically check drones for abnormal behavior
      or status LED malfunction. Note, however, that cryptographic sequencers will
      not incur this behavior.
  - tweak: In response to complaints about rogue drones, Nanotrasen engineers have
      allowed factory resets on all drones by simply using a wrench.
  - experiment: Central Command reminds drones to immediately retreat, if possible,
      when a law override is begun. Not doing so may anger the gods and incur their
      wrath!
  - rscadd: Some virus symptoms that had no messages now have them.
  - rscadd: 'New virology symptom: Weakness. This will cause stamina damage and fainting
      spells.'

      scanning module which will display the potential research data gained from experimenting
      with an object. Nanotrasen has also released drivers which shall enable the
      prototype hardsuit's built in scan visor.
  - rscadd: Supporting this new design, Nanotrasen has seen fit to provide blueprints
      for Science Goggles to the station's protolathe.

      will have to use a pen to convert them afterwards.

      the detectives hat.
  - sounddel: When Nar-Sie is created, they now use the old sound effect.

  - experiment: After searching through the Sleeping Carp's ancient monastery in deep
      space, more secrets have been uncovered of their traditional fighting techniques.

      to butcher their corpse to retrieve their contents.
  - bugfix: butchering a corpse no longer also attacks it.

  - tweak: Slimes now attaches themselves to mobs via buckling.
2015-10-16:
  MrStonedOne:
  - rscadd: Added a reconnect option to the file menu. This will allow you to reconnect
      to the game server without closing and re-opening the game window. This should
      also prevent another byond ad from playing during reconnections.
  Xhuis:
  - rscadd: A gamebreaking bug has been fixed with buckets. You can now wear them
      on your head.
  bgobandit:
  - rscadd: The Grape Growers Consortium has complained that Nanotrasen kitchens do

      to drone legs. They are no longer affected by lack of gravity or spacewind!
  - bugfix: Drones can now set Airlock access on RCDs.
  bgobandit:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen loves recycling! In the highly unlikely occasion that your
      space station accumulates gibs, scoop 'em up and bring them to chemistry to
      recycle into soap, candles, or even delicious meat product!
  - rscadd: L3 biohazard closets now contain bio-bag satchels for the safe collection
      of biowaste products, such as slime extracts.

      glass) is now done by clicking them, similar to spray. Reagent dispensers (watertank,
      fueltank, pepperspray dispenser) no longer have their own transfer amounts and
      use the reagent container's transfer amount instead (except for sprays which
      get 50u for faster refilling).
2015-10-23:
  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: 'Syndicate bomb payloads will now detonate if set on fire long enough.
      Note that the casings for the bombs is fireproof, so if you want to set fire
      to a bombcore you''ll need to remove it from the case first (cut all wires,
      then crowbar it out). A reassurance from our explosives department: it is, and
      always has been, impossible to detonate a syndicate bomb that isn''t ticking
      with wirecutters alone.'
  Xhuis:
  - rscadd: Geiger counters have been added and are obtainable from autolathes and
      EngiVends. They will measure the severity of radiation pulses while in your
      pockets, belt, or hands. One can scan a mob's radiation level by switching to
      Help intent and clicking on it. These counters never really discard the radiation
      they store, and rumor has it this can be used in nefarious ways...
  - tweak: When a mob is impacted by radiation, the radiation is now relayed to all
      items on the mob.
2015-10-24:
  Kor:
  - rscadd: The friendly gold slime reaction now spawns three mobs.
  phil235:
  - tweak: Changed the effects of alcohol to be more realistic. The effects of alcohol
      now appear twice as fast. Drunkenness now scales with how much alcohol is in
      you, not how long you've been drinking. This means drinking very little but
      continuously no longer makes you very drunk, or confused/slurring for a long
      time or give you alcohol poisoning. The dizziness and slurring effects now properly
      scale with how drunk you are (and dizziness is generally more pronounced).
2015-10-25:
  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: The spell Charge has been added to the spellbook. It can be used to extend
      the life of magic and energy weapons and even reset the cooldowns of held wizards!

      and raises the dead! Can't be used on yourself however.

2015-10-26:
  Fox P McCloud:
  - tweak: Standardizes the slowdown of most spacesuits to 1 as opposed to 2.
  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: 48x48 pixel mode (x1.5 zoom) has been added to the Icons menu (top left).
      While playing in 32x32 or 64x64 will still provide a clearer looking station,
      for those of us with resolutions that fall into the gap between the two zooms
      this can provide a more consistant looking station than stretch to fit.
  - rscadd: 96x96 pixel mode (x3 zoom) has also been added for our players who enjoy
      looking at spacemen on their 4k monitors at a crisp and consistent scale.
  - tweak: The lich spell has been subjected to some gentle nerfing. When you die
      a string of energy will tie your new body to your old body for a short time,
      aiding others in determining your location. The duration of this beam scales
      with the number of deaths you've avoided.
  - tweak: Additionally the post revival stun now also scales in this way.
  - tweak: The spell will also fail if the item and the wizard don't share the same
      z level, though the nature of space means the odds of the item (or the wizard)
      looping around back to the station is pretty high.
  - rscadd: The spell is still really good.
2015-10-27:
  Joan:
  - bugfix: You can now click on things under timestop effects, instead of clicking
      the effect and looking like a fool.
  Kor:
  - rscadd: Added a zombie mob that turns its kills into more zombies. Currently adminspawn
      and xenobio only.
  - rscadd: Using water with a red slime extract will now yield a speed potion. Using

  MrStonedOne:
  - rscadd: You may now access the setup character screen when not in the lobby via
      the game preferences verb in the preferences tab
  - rscadd: The round end restart delay can now be configured by server operators.
      New servers will default to 90 seconds while old servers will default to the
      old 25 seconds until they import the config option to their server.
2015-10-28:

      (jobs only) or the medHUD of humans.
  - rscadd: Ghost will now get clickable icon alerts from events such as being put
      in a cloner, drones being created, Nar-sie being summoned, among others. The
      older chat messages were kept. These alerts can not be toggled.

      saving some annoying inventory shuffle at roundstart.
2015-10-30:
  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: Slimepeople can now split if they contain 200 units of slime jelly, and
      slimepeople will now slowly generate slime jelly up to 200 units provided they
      are very well fed. Split slimepeople are NOT player controlled, but rather the
      original slime person can swap between the two mobs at will. If one of the slimepeople
      should die under player control, the player won't be able to swap back to their
      living body. Splitting only creates a new body, any items you have on you are
      not duplicated.
  - rscadd: Slimepeople now take half damage from sources of heat, but double damage
      from sources of cold. Lasers good, Space bad.
2015-11-01:
  Gun Hog:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen listens! After numerous complaints and petitions from Security
      personnel regarding energy weapon upkeep, we have authorized the construction
      and maintenance of your station's weapon rechargers. As an added bonus, we have
      also provided a more modular design for the devices, allowing for greater recharge
      rates if fitted with a more efficient capacitor!
  - rscadd: Added Diagnostic HUDs! They can be used to view the health and cell status
      of borgs and mechs. Silicons have them built in, Roboticists get two in their
      locker, and the RD's hardsuit has one built in.
  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: The number of roundstart head revolutionaries nows depends on the roundstart
      security force as well as the roundstart heads
  - rscadd: The maximum number of head revs is 3, the minimum is 1. If there is fewer
      than three station heads there will never be more than that number of head revs
      at roundstart. For every three vacant security roles (Head of Security/Warden/Security
      Officer/Detective) at roundstart the number of starting head revs will be reduced
      by 1.
  - rscadd: Head revolutionaries can be gained during play if the security/head roles
      are filled. They are drawn from existing revolutionaries.
  - rscadd: Added dental implant surgery. While targeting the mouth drill a hole in
      a tooth then stick a pill in there for hands free later use.
  Kor:
  - rscadd: Added an experimental control console for Xenobiology. Ask the admins
      if you'd like to try it out. It may not work on maps other than Box if they
      have renamed the Xenobiology Lab.
  - rscadd: Injecting blood into a cerulean slime will yield a special one use set
      of blueprints that will allow you to expand the territory your camera can cover.
  Kor and Remie:
  - rscadd: Added as series of laser reflector structures, the frame of which can
      be built with 5 metal sheets.
  - rscadd: Completing the frame with 5 glass sheets creates a mirror that will reflect
      lasers at a 90 degree angle.
  - rscadd: Completing the frame with 10 reinforced glass sheets creates a double
      sided mirror that reflects lasers at a 90 degree angle.
  - rscadd: Completing the frame with a single diamond sheet creates a box that will
      redirect all lasers that hit it from any angle in a single direction.

      button.
  - rscadd: Added new outfit that allows admins to dress people up in the chrono equipment
      easier.

      by dragging the target away.

  - tweak: Revenant ability costs tweaked; Defile now costs 40 essence to cast, Overload
      Lights now costs 45 essence to cast, and Malfunction now costs 50 essence to
      cast.
  - tweak: Malfunction now affects non-machine objects, even if they're not being
      held by a human.
  - tweak: Defile does an extremely low amount of toxin damage to humans and confuses,
      but does much less stamina damage and stuns the revenant for slightly longer.
  - tweak: Overload Lights will no longer shock if the light is broken after a light
      is chosen to shock an area.
  Kor:
  - rscadd: Using water on a dark blue slime extract will now yield a new potion capable

  - tweak: Bluespace anomaly will occasionally teleport mobs away from it in a small
      radius.

      things.
  MrStonedOne:
  - bugfix: Away mission loading will no longer improperly expand the width of the

  - rscdel: You can no longer throw the bolt whenever you want, it will fire itself
      once it's done charging.
  - rscadd: Getting hit by a bolt will do a flat 30 burn now, as opposed to scaling
      with how long the wizard spent charging the spell. Unless said wizard made a
      habit of charging lightning bolt to near maximum every time this is a buff to
      damage.
  - rscdel: Every time the bolt jumps the next shock will do five less burn damage.
  - rscadd: Lightning bolts can still jump back to the same body, so the maximum number
      of bolts you can be hit by in a single casting is three, and the maximum amount
      of damage you could take for that is 60 burn.

  PKPenguin321:
  - rscadd: Teleprods can now be constructed. Make them via tablecrafting, or by putting
      a bluespace crystal onto a stunprod. They warp the target to a random nearby

      walls around the camera. On the other hand, cameras with an xray upgrade let
      you see through walls. Unfocused camera now give you the same effect as when
      you are nearsighted. Being inside closets, morgue container and disposal bins
      give you some vision impairments.

      whenever they're on blobs near a node or the core.
  - tweak: Blob expansion no longer has a chance to fail inversely proportional with
      the expanding blob's health. Blobs still, however, expand at roughly the same
      rate as they do currently.

  - rscadd: Adds Penetrating Spines, which is sea green and does brute damage through
      armor. The damage can still be reduced by bio protection.

      the nearby area when hit with brute damage projectiles, from just when attacked
      by brute damage in melee.

      the 'blob' faction, such as blobbernauts and spores.

      balls. First ball comes with 32 energy (down from 300), fourth requires 256
      (down from 1200), and so on and on, doubling with each new ball. Balls after
      7 are increasingly harder to get than before, whereas balls before 6 are easier
      to get.
  - rscadd: MULTIBOLT IS BACK!

      twice the power of a stage 3 singulo with maxed collectors without any balls,

      in half to make tablecrafting less annoying to use.

      brain can't be put into a robot, they can still be put inside a brainless humanoid
      corpse and cloned, but deffibing the corpse always fails (can't revive someone
      with a brain beaten to a pulp).

      bodies since they're the only ones that have hair. Sorry lizards and plasmamen!
      You'll get your turn next time.

      you want your ghost sprite to show both hair and directional sprites, only directional

      and lets you configure how other ghosts appear to you: as their own setting,
      as the form they chose but without any hair or directional sprites, or as the
      simple white ghost sprite if you''re sick of those premium users with their
      rainbow ghosts.'
  - experiment: The layout of the ghost preference buttons has slightly changed. The
      old Choose Ghost Form and Choose Ghost Orbit are now a part of Ghost Customization,
      which also contains the new Ghost Accessories button. Clicking Ghost Customization
      will send you directly to Ghost Accessories if you don't have premium. The Preferences
      tab now also contains the Ghost Display button, which lets you configure how
      other ghosts appear to you.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where the toggles for Ghost Accessories and Ghosts of Others
      in the Preferences menu wouldn't save your preference update to your save file.

      energy sword, dualsaber) to prevent them taking limbs off in a single hit.
  - rscadd: The chaplain has two new weapons (they are mechanically identical to previous

  Robustin:
  - experiment: There are rumors that the Cult's 'Talisman of Construction', which
      turns ordinary metal for construct shells, can be used on plasteel to create
      structures. If the stories are true, the cult has been producing relics of incredible
      power through this transmutation.
  coiax:

  - rscadd: Lings have a new default ability, Hivemind Link. This lets you bring a
      neck-grabbed victim into hivemind communications after short period of time.
      You can talk to victims who are in crit/muted and perhaps persuade them to help
      you, give you intel, or even a PDA code. The link will stabilize crit victims
      to help ensure they do not die during the link.

  nullbear:
  - tweak: Wetness updates less often.
  - rscadd: Wetness now stacks. Spraying lube over a tile that already has lube, will
      make the lube take longer to dry. Likewise, dumping 100 units of lube will take
      longer to dry than if only 10 units were dumped. (lube used to last just as
      long, regardless of whether it was 1u, or 100u) There is a limit, however, and
      you can't stack infinite lube.
  - tweak: Hotter temperatures cause water to evaporate more quickly. At 100C, water
      will boil away instantly.
  - rscadd: About 5 seconds of wetness are removed from a tile for each unit of drying
      agent. Absorbant Galoshes remain the most effective method of drying, and dry

  coiax:
  - rscdel: Gatling gun removed from R&D for pressing ceremonial reasons.
  phil235:
  - tweak: Pull and Grab are merged together. Pulling stays unchanged. Using an empty
      hand with grab intent on a mob will pull them. Using an empty hand with grab
      intent on a mob that you're already pulling will try to upgrade your grip to
      aggressive grab>neck grab>kill grab. Aggressive grabs no longer stun you, but
      they act exactly like a handcuff, preventing you from using your hands until
      you escape the grip. You can break free from the grip by trying to move or using
      the resist button.
  - tweak: Someone pulling a restrained mob now swap position with them instead of
      getting blocked by the mob, unable to even push them.

      head to stop it coming back.

  - rscadd: Added clockwork reclaimers. Ghosts can now click on Ratvar to become clockwork
      reclaimers - small constructs capable of forcefully converting those that still
      resist Ratvar's reign. Alt-clicking a valid target will allow the reclaimer
      to leap onto the head of any non-servant, latching onto their head and converting
      the target if they are able. The target will be outfitted with an unremovable,
      acid-proof hat version of the reclaimer. The reclaimer will be able to speak
      as normal and attack its host and anything nearby. If the reclaimer's host goes
      unconscious or dies, it will leap free.
  - rscadd: Added pinion airlocks. These airlocks can only be opened by servants and
      conventional deconstruction will not work on them. They can be created by proselytizing

  RemieRichards:
  - rscadd: Slimes may now be ordered to attack! You must be VERY good friends with
      the slime(s) to give this command, asking them to attack their friends or other
      slimes will result in them liking you less so be careful!
  X-TheDark:
  - rscadd: Mech battery replacement improved. The inserted battery's charge will
      be set to the same percentage of the removed one's (or 10%, if removed one's
      was less).
  coiax:
  - bugfix: Clicking the (F) link when an AI talks in binary chat will follow its
      camera eye, the same as when (F) is clicked for its radio chat.

  - rscadd: Cloning pods now grab the clone's mind when the body is ejected, rather
      than when it starts cloning.
  - rscadd: Wizards have been experimenting with summoning the slightly less lethal
      "laughter demon". Please be aware that these demons appear to be nearly as dangerous
      as their slaughter cousins. But adorable, nonetheless.
  kevinz000:
  - rscadd: Gravity Guns! It is a mildly expensive R&D gun that has a 5 second cooldown
      between shots, but doesn't need to be recharged. It has two modes, attract and
      repulse. For all your gravity-manipulation needs!
2016-06-07:
  Bobylein:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen is finally able to source transparent bottles for chemistry.
  Iamgoofball:
  - experiment: The Greytide Virus got some teeth.
  Joan:
  - wip: This is a bunch of Clockwork Cult changes.
  - rscadd: Added the Clockwork Obelisk, an Application scripture that produces a
      clockwork obelisk, which can Hierophant Broadcast a large message to all servants
      or open a Spatial Gateway with 5 uses and a 10 second duration to any conscious
      servant or clockwork obelisk.
  - wip: Spatial Gateways of any source have doubled uses and duration when the target
      is a clockwork obelisk.
  - rscadd: Added the Mania Motor, an Application scripture that produces a mania
      motor, which, while active, causes hallucinations and brain damage in all nearby
      humans.
  - wip: The Mania Motor will try to convert any non-servant human directly adjacent
      to it at an additional power cost and will remove brain damage, hallucinations,
      and the druggy effect from servants.
  - rscadd: Added the Vitality Matrix, an Application scripture that produces a sigil
      that will slowly drain health from non-servants that remain on it. Servants
      that remain on the sigil will instead be healed with the vitality drained from
      non-servants.
  - wip: The Vitality Matrix can revive dead servants for a cost of 25 vitality plus
      all non-oxygen damage the servant has. If it cannot immediately revive a servant,
      it will still heal their corpse.
  - experiment: Most clockwork structures, including the Mending Motor, Interdiction
      Lens, and the newly added Clockwork Obelisk and Mania Motor, now require power
      to function.
  - wip: Mending Motors can still use alloy for power.
  - tweak: The Sigil of Transmission has been remade into a power battery and will
      power directly adjecent clockwork structures. Sigils of Transmission start off
      with 4000 power and can be recharged with Volt Void.
  - tweak: Volt Void drains somewhat more power, but will not damage the invoker unless
      they drain too much power. Invokers with augmented limbs will instead have those
      limbs healed unless they drain especially massive amounts of power.
  - wip: Using Volt Void on top of a Sigil of Transmission will transfer most of the
      power drained to the Sigil of Transmission, effectively making it far less likely
      to damage the invoker.
  - rscdel: You can no longer stack most sigils and clockwork objects with themself.
      You can still have multiple different objects or sigils on a tile, however.
  - tweak: The Break Will Script has been renamed to Dementia Doctrine, is slightly
      faster, and causes slightly more brain damage.
  - tweak: The Judicial Visor now uses an action button instead of alt-click. Cultists
      of Nar-Sie judged by the visor will be stunned for half duration, but will be
      set on fire.
  - tweak: Multiple scriptures have had their component requirements changed. The
      Summon Judicial Visor Script has been reduced from a Script to a Driver.
  - rscadd: Recollection will now show both required and consumed components.
  - tweak: Clockwork Marauders can now emerge from their host if their host is at
      or below 60% total health(for humans, this is 20 health out of crit)
  - tweak: Clockwork Marauders will slowly heal if directly adjacent to their host
      and have a slightly larger threshold for their no-Fatigue bonus damage.
  Quiltyquilty:
  - rscadd: Botany, atmospherics and cargo now all have access to high-capacity watertanks.
  - rscadd: The bar has now been outfitted with custom bar stools.
  Xhuis:
  - rscdel: Removed the global message played when Nar-Sie _begins_ to spawn (but

      and is much quicker when the imbiber is asleep.
  - tweak: Suit storage units now take three seconds to enter (up from one) and have
      different sounds and messages for UV ray cauterization.
  - bugfix: Fixed some bugs with the suit storage unit, inserting mobs, and contents
      to seemed to duplicate themselves.
  - bugfix: The Summon Nar-Sie rune can now only be drawn on original station tiles
      and fails to invoke if scribed on the station then moved elsewhere.
  coiax:
  - rscdel: Bluespace shelter capsules can no longer be used on shuttles.
  - rscadd: Bluespace shelters may have different capsules stored. View what your
      capsule has inside by examining it.
  - rscdel: The Nar'sie rune cannot be scribed on shuttles or off Z-level.
  - rscadd: The Raise Dead rune automatically grabs the ghost of the raised corpse.
  - rscadd: Deadchat is now notified when a sentient mob dies.
  phil235:
  - rscadd: Monkeys and all other animals that should have blood now has it. Beating
      them up will make you and your weapon bloody, just like beating a human does.
      Dragging them when wounded and lying will leave a blood trail. Their blood is
      still mostly cosmetic, they suffer no effects from low blood level, unlike humans.
  - rscadd: When a mob leaves a blood trail while dragged, it loses blood. You can
      no longer drag a corpse to make an inifinite amount of blood trails, because
      once the victim's blood reaches a certain threshold it no longer leaves a blood
      trail (and no longer lose any more blood). The threshold depends on how much
      damage the mob has taken. You can always avoid hurting the dragged mob by making
      them stand up or by buckling them to something or by putting them in a container.
  - rscdel: You can no longer empty a mob of its blood entirely with a syringe, once
      the mob's blood volume reaches a critically low level you are unable to draw
      any more blood from it.
  - tweak: A changeling absorbing a human now sucks all their blood.

  GunHog:

      and water to any soil - hydroponic or otherwise - that it's planted in.
  - rscadd: Added cherry bombs, a mutated variant of blue cherries that have an explosively
      good taste. Oh, and don't pluck the stems.
  coiax:
  - tweak: The beacons from support guardians are now structures, rather than replacing
      the floor tile. In practice, this will change little, aside from not leaving
      empty plating when a beacon is removed because a new one has been placed.
  nullbear:
  - tweak: Removes the restriction on wormhole jaunters, preventing them from teleporting
      you to beacons on other z-levels.

      the Syndicate's immoral goals which cannot coexist with their own. They've decided
      to unlist their martial arts scroll from their uplink.
  - tweak: Nanotrasen News Reporter, Timato Vegetable, is on the scene where the QM
      is being publicly arrested for commanding a service borg to print him an infinite
      amount of money to profit from cargo exports. Space Cash printed from service
      borgs has been officially legalized, and precautions have been taken place.

      with a natural muscle relaxant.
  - rscadd: Bolamine can now be produced in chemistry by reacting Frost Oil with Space
      Drugs.  It slows down the user, and drains their stamina.

      crafting ticks to 45, gauze is 55 from 400. In simple terms each bandage takes
      6 seconds to craft, gauze takes 8.
  - tweak: bandage heal duration has been lowered drastically from 120 seconds to
      40 seconds, bandages now heal 1 damage per second to account for their 40 total
      heal amount.
  - tweak: Medical kit bandages heal  duration is 40 seconds as-well but its worth
      mentioning that they heal a bit more, their heal amount being 65, meaning they

  - rscadd: Changelings have successfully fought-off the NT retrovirus bioweapon that
      forced them to change their single-target hallucination stings into mass-ending
